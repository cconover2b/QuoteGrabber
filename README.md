**# Overview**

I wrote this QuoteGrabber to grab a quote from an API. I used a simple API that I made just to test my skills.

**# Development Environment**

Java 18, Maven 3.85, and Intellij

I used the Java language

**# Useful Websites**

- [JDK 18 Documentation - Home (oracle.com)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/index.html)
- [Maven â€“ Welcome to Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [IntelliJ IDEA: The Capable & Ergonomic Java IDE by JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

**# Future Work**

- JSON parse the string to grab specific pieces of the string.
- I would like to be able to send the quotes that I grab to my Firestore database.
- I would like to be able to edit the quote before sending it off.
